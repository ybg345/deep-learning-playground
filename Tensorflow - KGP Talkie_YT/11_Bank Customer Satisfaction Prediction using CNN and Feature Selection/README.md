In this video I have shown how you can acheive accuracy (96%) better than Kagglers solution 84%. Santander bank has given a task to Kagglers as follows.

"
From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

Santander Bank is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

In this competition, you'll work with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.
