Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills – may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness, often leading to death.

Children with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anaemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. In adults, multi-organ failure is also frequent. In malaria endemic areas, people may develop partial immunity, allowing asymptomatic infections to occur.

## Content
The dataset contains 2 folders - Infected - Uninfected

And a total of 27,558 images.

## Acknowledgements
This Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/ And uploaded here, so anybody trying to start working with this dataset can get started immediately, as to download the dataset from NIH website is quite slow.
