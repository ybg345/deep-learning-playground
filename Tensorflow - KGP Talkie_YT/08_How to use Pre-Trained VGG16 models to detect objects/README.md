In this lesson, I have shown how you can use pretrained VGG16 model to predict the objects.

The VGG network architecture was introduced by Simonyan and Zisserman in their 2014 paper, Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition.

This network is characterized by its simplicity, using only 3Ã—3 convolutional layers stacked on top of each other in increasing depth. Reducing volume size is handled by max pooling. Two fully-connected layers, each with 4,096 nodes are then followed by a softmax classifie

In 2014, 16 and 19 layer networks were considered very deep (although we now have the ResNet architecture which can be successfully trained at depths of 50-200 for ImageNet and over 1,000 for CIFAR-10)

Due to its depth and number of fully-connected nodes, VGG is over 533MB for VGG16 and 574MB for VGG19.
