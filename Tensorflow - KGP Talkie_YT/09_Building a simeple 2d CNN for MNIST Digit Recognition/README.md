In this lesson, I have build an accurate 2D CNN model to acheive 99.2% accuracy on MNIST Digit Recognition Dataset which is good accuracy.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

MNIST dataset is available in keras datasets to directly use in the project.
