What is Tensorflow?
Currently, the most famous deep learning library in the world is Google's TensorFlow. Google product uses machine learning in all of its products to improve the search engine, translation, image captioning or recommendations.

Tensorflow architecture works in three parts:
Preprocessing the data
Build the model
Train and estimate the model

It is called Tensorflow because it takes input as a multi-dimensional array which is also known as tensors.
I am assuming that you know a little about the machine learning and deep learning

Why Every Data Scientist Learn Tensorflow 2.x not Tensorflow 1.x
There are many changes in TensorFlow 2.0 to make users more productive, including removing redundant APIs, making APIs more consistent (Unified RNNs, Unified Optimizers), and better integrating with the Python runtime with Eager execution
API Cleanup
Eager execution
No more globals
Functions, not sessions (session.run())
Use Keras layers and models to manage variables
It is faster
It takes less space
More consistent
